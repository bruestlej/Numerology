ðŸ”¢ Project Description

Numerology Analyzer is a Python class designed to calculate various numerology traits based on a personâ€™s name and date of birth (DOB). This program uses basic numerological methods (like reducing numbers and converting letters to numbers) to compute attributes such as:
- Attitude Number
- Birthday Number
- Life Path Number
- (Partially implemented) Soul Number, Personality Number, and Power Name Number
The class includes private helper methods for number reduction and character conversion, demonstrating encapsulation and string manipulation.

âœ¨ Key Features
- Accepts a user's name and DOB in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Calculates and reduces numerological numbers.
- Shows how to map letters to numerology values using ASCII conversion.
- Uses private methods for internal calculations.
- Partially implements advanced numerology concepts (soul, personality, power name).

ðŸŽ¯ Who It's For

This project is ideal for:
- Intermediate Python learners who are:
  - Practicing class creation and object-oriented programming
  - Learning to use private methods (__methodName)
  - Working with string slicing, ASCII conversion, and loops
- Students in computer science or software development courses who want a creative, personal project to apply OOP skills
- Anyone interested in numerology or astrology who wants to turn it into a Python app
- Educators teaching encapsulation, string manipulation, and method design
